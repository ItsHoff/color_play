* Intro 0 - 2
** RGB 0
  * Topic: playing with colors
  * Though first a bit of intro into computer colors (RGB)
  * Based on trichromacy
    - Short, medium and long cone cells respond differently to different wavelengths of light
  * But how continuous spectra is converted to RGB?
** CIE Standard observer 1
  * International Commission on Illumination (CIE)
  * Scale spectra and integrate
  * Many spectra = same color
  * However, impossible to display, because of unphysical primaries
** Chromaticity diagram + sRGB triangle
  * All possible color at constant brightness
    - Brightness normalized chroma from xyz color
  * Monochromatic spectra at the edges
  * Most commonly used colorspace for displays is sRGB
    - subset of xyz
  * First tried to play with xyz, but run into problems of undisplayable colors
* Permutations 3 - 6
  * 3: No change
  * 4: Red not changed
  * 5: Green not changed
  * 6: Blue not changed
* Channels 7
  * 0: urban, nature, people
  * 1: people, nature, urban
  * 2: nature, urban, people
  * 3: people, urban, nature
  * 4: nature, people, urban
  * 5: urban, people, nature
* Hidden 8 - 10
  * val = 0.05 * (20 - view)
  * last value = 0.005
* Movement 11
  * Color is not the only source of information
